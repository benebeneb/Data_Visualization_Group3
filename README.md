# AI Readability Dashboard

## Overview

The **AI Readability Dashboard** is an interactive R Shiny app designed to compare the readability and linguistic features of text generated by different AI models. This tool allows users to evaluate and visualize how outputs from models like **GPT‑4o**, **GPT‑4o Mini**, **DeepSeek**, and a baseline **News Corpus** vary across a wide range of metrics.

## Features

- **Model Selector**: Compare outputs from different models side-by-side.
- **Score Selector**: Choose from 12 readability and linguistic metrics including Flesch-Kincaid, SMOG Index, Lexical Density, etc.
- **Visualizations**:
    - **Ridgeline plots** showing distribution of all scores per model.
    - **Histograms** of complexity scores.
    - **Score comparisons** across models using ridgelines.
    - **Scatter plots** comparing prompt and response scores for paired metrics.
- **Value Metrics**: Summary statistics for average sentence length, word length, TTR, and subordinate clauses.
- **Responsive Layout & Theme**: Uses a custom-designed CSS theme and modern BS4 components for a clean UI.

## Technologies

- `shiny`, `bs4Dash`, `tidyverse`, `ggridges`, `shinyWidgets`, `shinyjs`
- Custom Inter font via Google Fonts
- Responsive styling with custom CSS for value boxes, buttons, and layout

## Required R Packages

Before running the app, you can install all necessary packages using:

```R
install.packages(c(
  "shiny", "bs4Dash", "shinyWidgets", "shinyjs", 
  "tidyverse", "ggridges", "readr", "stringr", 
  "RColorBrewer", "fresh", "fontawesome"
))
```

## Data

Each model is associated with a `.csv` file containing linguistic metrics for both prompts and responses:
- `4o.csv` – GPT‑4o
- `4o-mini.csv` – GPT‑4o Mini
- `deepseek.csv` – DeepSeek
- `news_articles.csv` – News Corpus (used as a real-world baseline)

Each file contains columns like:

```bsh
id, text_type, flesch_kincaid_grade, gunning_fog, avg_sentence_length, avg_word_length, type_token_ratio, subordinate_clauses, complexity, etc.
```

Example row from `deepseek.csv`:

```bsh
2, response, 10.5, 47.28, 12.01, 17.25, 5.04, 0.826, 9.36, ...
```

## File Structure

```bsh
- app.R                # Main Shiny app (UI + server)
- www/
  └── logo.png  # Custom logo for your dashboard team
- 4o.csv               # GPT‑4o metrics
- 4o-mini.csv          # GPT‑4o Mini metrics
- deepseek.csv         # DeepSeek metrics
- news_articles.csv    # Corpus baseline metrics
```

## How to Run

To launch the dashboard locally:

```R
shiny::runApp("app.R")
```

Ensure all CSVs are in the root directory and your logo (`logo.png`) is placed in the `www/` folder.
